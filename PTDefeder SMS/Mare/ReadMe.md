## From [MareG76](https://github.com/MareG76/ProfitTrailer-TheNorthStar-PTMagic-PTDefender_Settings)
"Allowed Markets" change "MDAETH" to pairs that you are defending, can be more than one comma separated ("MDAETH, ZRXETH, ICXETH"). "Allowed Markets" can't be empty otherwise the PTM will crash. Feel free to modify this settings to suits your needs because they work for me but might not be the best solution for you so use at your own risk.
