// ================================================
// =============================  GLOBAL SETTINGS  
// ================================================

	  // Rather than adjusting each pairs/DCA file individually, you can make all
	  // your changes in PTMagics Global Settings.  It will override any settings 
	  // in the individual settings pairs/dca/indicator files. You may also 
	  // include any additional lines as you see fit, as long as they are valid Profit Trailer parameters. 
          //	  
	  // Keep in mind, certain changes may significantly alter the intended functionality 
	  // and approach built into the base strategies.  The settings included here by default 
	  // are to allow you to easily adjust your money mangement preferences according to 
	  // your own trading style and risk tolerance.  


	  // REVIEW THE FOLLOWING VALUES CAREFULLY to fit your individual level of risk,
	  // and avoid over-extending yourself! You MUST adjust these for EVERY global setting.
	  //         intial_cost
	  //         keep_balance
	  //         max_trading_pairs
	  //         
          // For details on how the all the various settings work, take your time and study
	  // both the Profit Trailer and PTMagic wikis.
	  //
	  // REMEMBER! When using initial_cost %, the calculation is a percentage
	  // of what remains AFTER deducting the value of keep_balance.  Thus, changing
	  // the value of keep_balance can increase or decrease the result of 
	  // initial_cost %.
	  // 
	  // ALL of the values used for market trend analysis are for example only, and may
	  // not be the best values to fit your trading style.  Doing your own testing and 
	  // analysis before going live is strongly encouraged.	  
    
    
// ================================================
// ======================  COIN SPECIFIC SETTINGS 
// ================================================

	  // Similar to the Global Settings you may add any additional Profit Trailer parameters
	  // you want to the single-market settings.   These will only be applied to
	  // coins which meet the specified trend conditions.  Keep in mind, only settings that are 
	  // designated "coin-specific" by Profit Trailer, will function correctly.
	  //
	  // That being said, it is possible to get creative and alter anything you like
	  // so that more sophisticated coin-specific settings can be applied to extend
	  // your strategy in new and interesting ways.  This is where the true power 
	  // of PTM lies -- it's ability to customize an entire buy and sell strategy 
	  // on a per-coin basis, regardless of global market conditions.  However this 
	  // would be for more advanced users who are intimately familiar with Profit
	  // Trailer, and PTMagic.
