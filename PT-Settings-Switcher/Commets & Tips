      // Some coins that have been de-listed, still return a value
      // through the Binance API.  Ignore these to avoid corrupt trend data in PTMagic.
      // See issue #583 at https://github.com/Legedric/ptmagic/issues/583
      // Until this issue is resolved, you should add any other other coins to
      // this list that return a value of "NaN" or "âˆž" in the market analyzer.
      // If you are trading in a market other than BTC, you should change
      // the coin pair accordingly.
      
      
// ================================================
// =============================  GLOBAL SETTINGS  
// ================================================

	  // Rather than adjusting each pairs/DCA file individually, you can make all
	  // your changes in PTMagics Global Settings.  It will override any settings 
	  // in the individual settings pairs/dca/indicator files. You may also 
	  // include any additional lines as you see fit, as long as they are valid Profit Trailer parameters. 
          //	  
	  // Keep in mind, certain changes may significantly alter the intended functionality 
	  // and approach built into the base strategies.  The settings included here by default 
	  // are to allow you to easily adjust your money mangement preferences according to 
	  // your own trading style and risk tolerance.  


	  // REVIEW THE FOLLOWING VALUES CAREFULLY to fit your individual level of risk,
	  // and avoid over-extending yourself! You MUST adjust these for EVERY global setting.
	  //         intial_cost(_percentage)
	  //         keep_balance (_percentage)
	  //         max_trading_pairs
          // 
          // If using keep_balance, keep_balance_percentage must be set to 0
	  // If using keep_balance_percentage, keep_balance must be set to 0
	  // If using initial_cost, initial_cost_percentage must be set to 0
	  // If using initial_cost_percentage, initial_cost must be set to 0
	  //         
          // For details on how the all the various settings work, take your time and study
	  // both the Profit Trailer and PTMagic wikis.
	  //
	  // REMEMBER! When using initial_cost_percentage, the calculation is a percentage
	  // of what remains AFTER deducting the value of keep_balance.  Thus, changing
	  // the value of keep_balance can increase or decrease the result of 
	  // initial_cost_percentage.
	  // 
	  // ALL of the values used for market trend analysis are for example only, and may
	  // not be the best values to fit your trading style.  Doing your own testing and 
	  // analysis before going live is strongly encouraged.	  


	  // To specify a WHITELIST of coins, use enabled_pairs.  Replace "ALL" with your list of coins. 
	  // eg., "enabled_pairs": "ETH, XRP, XLM, ZRX"  You must do this for every global setting.
    
    
// ================================================
// ======================  COIN SPECIFIC SETTINGS 
// ================================================

	  // Similar to the Global Settings you may add any additional Profit Trailer parameters
	  // you want to the single-market settings.   These will only be applied to
	  // coins which meet the specified trend conditions.  Keep in mind, only settings that are 
	  // designated "coin-specific" by Profit Trailer, will function correctly.
	  // 
	  // It is advised that you not alter any single buy or sell parameters,
	  // without considering how it will affect all of your global settings.
	  // If your different settings are using different stategies, eg., one uses EMACROSS
	  // and another uses EMAGAIN, a change here to buy_value and trail_value
	  // could have potentially unintended consequences for the different settings files.
	  // If you did want to change the complete buy or sell strategy for specific coins,
	  // you would need to include the entire strategy -- for example:
	  //
	  // DEFAULT_A_buy_strategy
	  // DEFAULT_A_buy_value
	  // DEFAULT_A_buy_value_limit
	  // DEFAULT_B_buy_strategy
	  // DEFAULT_B_buy_value
	  // DEFAULT_B_buy_value_limit
	  // DEFAULT_C_buy_strategy
	  // DEFAULT_C_buy_value
	  // DEFAULT_C_buy_value_limit
	  // You also might need to disable other strategies that exist in your 
	  // settings with DEFAULT_D_buy_strategy = Disabled.
	  //
	  // That being said, it is possible to get creative and alter anything you like
	  // so that more sophisticated coin-specific settings can be applied to extend
	  // your strategy in new and interesting ways.  This is where the true power 
	  // of PTM lies -- it's ability to customize an entire buy and sell strategy 
	  // on a per-coin basis, regardless of global market conditions.  However this 
	  // would be for more advanced users who are intimately familiar with Profit
	  // Trailer, and PTMagic.
